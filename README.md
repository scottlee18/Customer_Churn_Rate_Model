# Customer_Churn_Rate_Model
Explore data set and build model to best predict customer churn classification. 


This was an academic project to examine a anonymized customer data set for an insurance company and try to predict customer churn classifications. 
Thats is to predict if a customer, based off various data inputs, which customers would remain customers by renewing their policy, and which would leave.

This was completed in RStudio. A version of the code is available as an rmd file, however a pdf of the code output is available to view without needing to run the code and have the associated data files in the correct directories.
